XMessage  
I want to build an app where people can share their thoughts anonymously. Whether if a person is stressed or that they are sad, they are free to express their feelings on XMessage. Once their message is posted on the app, they will receive a reply from another user. Both users will not be able to know each others personal information, but rather, they can only send messages. This app aim to provide a form of mental support from an online world.  
Some of the app features includes:  
- Post messages
- Texting users
- Writing letters(penpal)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A challenge I encounter was that since it was the first time I worked with XCode, knowing how to navaigate the apps can be a bit confusing.
